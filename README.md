🍽️ CampusPlate
Smart Food Rescue Platform for Universities
Connecting surplus campus meals with students in need - turning waste into opportunity

🎯 Overview
CampusPlate is a revolutionary food rescue platform designed specifically for university campuses. We tackle two critical issues simultaneously: campus food waste and student food insecurity. By creating a real-time marketplace that connects surplus meals from dining services with students, we're building a more sustainable and equitable campus community.
Built for Memorial University of Newfoundland, CampusPlate demonstrates how technology can drive positive social and environmental impact.
